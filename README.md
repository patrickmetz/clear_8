An interpreting emulator for [chip8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) - written in Java.

About
-----

Its focus (besides emulating games in a fast, correct and convenient manner)  
is on using **clea**n and **r**eadable software components, which can be easily  
understood, maintained and extended.

It can be examined hands-on by emulation development beginners, helping  
them grasp how emulators re-create hardware and how everything can be  
connected to a graphical user interface and controlled from the outside.

This is achieved by

  - striving for [separation of concerns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns), high [cohesion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(computer_science)) and low [coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(computer_programming))
  -   meaningfully named classes, interfaces, methods and variables
   
  - helpful embedded documentation, placed in order to provide  
  additional insights
