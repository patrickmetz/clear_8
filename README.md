About
-----
**This is still a bug-ridden hobby project, updated at a leisurely pace, that is going to end up really nice some day :-)**

I stomped it out of the ground three years ago, almost forgot about it, just blew the dust off of it, and now turned it into my weekend project.

Goals
-----
* **clea**n and **r**eadable architecture, which can be easily understood, maintained and extended
* correct implementation of Cosmac VIP and SuperChip instruction sets
* extensive set of unit tests
* graphical debugger of current memory and cpu state, etc.
